			<h1>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL (HTTP)</h1>


			<p>- Application layer used primarily to retrieve hypertext (on hypermedia) documents and resources on the World Wide Web</p>


			<p>- Jointly developed by the W3C and the IETF</p>


			<p>Protocol - Set of rules needs to be followed</p>


			<p>HTTP 1.1 requires atleast the HOST request</p>


			<h1>FUNDAMENTALS</h1>
			<img src="./images/fundamentals.png" alt="fundamentals">

			<ul>
			  <li>HTTP typically runs on the top of TCP/IP, using TCP port 80 by default (TCP port 443 for HTTPS)</li>


			  <li>HTTP resources are identified using URIs (specifically in HTTP URLs)</li>


			  <li>HTTP is based on client-server achitecture</li>


			  <li>Clients are also known as User Agent (UA):</li>


			  <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
				<p>Web browsers, Web crawlers, e-mail clients, and other end user tools and applications</p>
			  </li>


			  <li>Servers:</li>


			  <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
				<p>origin servers, proxy servers, getaways, tunnels</p>
			  </li>


			  <li>HTTP uses a request-response standard protocol</li>


			  <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
				<p>The client sends an HTTP request message to the server</p>


				<p>The server processes the request and replies with an HTTP response message</p>

			  </li>


			  <li>HTTP is a stateless communications protocol</li>


			  <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
				<p>Servers do not keep informatin about clients in between requests</p>


				<p>Web applications effect session tracking using mechanism such as cookies on URL-encoded session information to keep track of related client requests</p>
			  </li>


			  <li>HTTP provides suport for other functionalities such as cahe control, content media type (MIME) specification, language and character set specification,<br>
			  content/transfer coding, client-server protocol negotiatons, persistent connections, request pipelining, etc.</li>
			</ul>


			<h1>COOKIE</h1>


			<p> HTTP Cookie which is also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie or simply cookie is small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while user is browsing. </p>


			<h1>CACHE</h1>


			<p>HTTP Cache is an information technology for the temporary local storage or copy of resource that is fetched from a server.</p>
			<img src="./images/cache.png" alt="cache">


			<h1>HTTP REQUEST METHODS</h1>


			<ul>
			  <li>GET</li>

			  <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
				<p>The GET method is commonly used in HTTP method, It is used to request from the server the retrieval if the source identified by the request URI and can be combine with conditional and/or range request headers to effect conditional and/or partial resource retrieval.</p>
			  </li>

			  <li>HEAD</li>

			  <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
				<p>The HEAD Method is identical to GET method, Method will asks for a response but without the response body. This is very useful for retrieving.</p>
			  </li>

			  <li>POST</li>

			  <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
				<p>The POST method requests that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.</p>
			  </li>

			  	  <li>PUT</li>

			  <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
				<p>The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity in the message body under the specified request URI.</p>
			  </li>

			  <li>TRACE</li>

			  <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
				<p>The TRACE method requests the server to "echo" back to the client of received request and typically used for testing or diagnostics of the request chain.</p>
			  </li>


			  <li>DELETE</li>

			  <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
				<p>The DELETE method requests the server to delete the resource identified by the Request-URI.</p>
			  </li>


			  <li>CONNECT</li>

			  <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
				<p>The CONNECT method is reserved for used of tunneling proxy servers and converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel.</p>
			  </li>

			  <li>OPTIONS</li>

			  <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
				<p>The OPTIONS method returns the HTTP methods what a server can do. It can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting. </p>
			  </li>
			</ul>
